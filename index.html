          <h2>Early Years</h2>
          <div class="tex">
            <p><b>Sachin Tendulkar</b>, in full Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, (born April 24, 1973, Bombay [Mumbai], India),
              Indian professional cricket player, considered by many to be one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In
              2012 he became the first cricketer to score 100 centuries (100 runs in a single innings) in international
              play.Tendulkar was given his first bat when he was 11 years of age. As a 14-year-old, he used it to score
              329 out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match. In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF
              Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but the Australian fast bowler Dennis
              Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his
              batting instead.[48] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an
              exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[49] A
              couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads
              and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior
              cricket award" (He was 14 years that time) "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me,"
              Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test
              centuries.[50][51] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against
              England in the semifinal in Bombay.[52][53] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every
              innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school
              game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go
              on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the
              opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over
              a thousand runs in the tournament.[54] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006,
              when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India</p>
              <span class="more">
                <p>On 14 November 1987, the 14-year-old Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy,
                  India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not
                  selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute
                  fielder.[43] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all
                  forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[43] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years
                  and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that
                  match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[56] He was
                  handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily
                  negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the
                  Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century
                  in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[57]
        
                  Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at
                  an average of 67.77, and was the eighth-highest run-scorer overall.[58] He also made an unbeaten century
                  in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of
                  India.[59] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club
                  banner in 1988 and 1989.[60] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay
                  by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving
                  Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[61]
        
                  His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the
                  Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][62] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his
                  domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[63] Another double century was
                  an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as
                  one of the best innings of his career</p>

            <h2>International career</h2>
            <div class="tex">
              <p><b></b>Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,after one first class season.[69] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack. In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth. In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.

                The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[78] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[79] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia.</p>
                <span class="more2">
                  <h3>Rise through the ranks</h3>
                  <p>Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls.[82] He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[83][84] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.

                    Tendulkar waits at the bowler's end.
                    Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[85] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[86]
                    
                    After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[87] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[88]</p>
                    
                    <p>This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[89] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[90] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[91][92] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[93] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah—the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[94] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[95]
                    
                    Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[96]
                    
                    The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[97] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[98] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[99] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[100] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan</p>

                <div class="tex">
                  <p>Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[7] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[322][323][324]

                    In 2012, Tendulkar was ranked number 8 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.[325]
                    
                    He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[326] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[327] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[328] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[329] and ODI matches (463).[330] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[331][332]
                    
                    Tendulkar has scored over 1,000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[330] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[233]
                    
                    He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[333] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[81] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[330] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[334] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[335] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[336] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1,000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most times in Test cricket history,[337] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[338] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.</p>
